# ZSH configurations

This configurations is a **minimal config** for your zsh (autosuggestions, syntax highlighting etc..) no oh-my-zsh required.

I'm not the author of the original configuration. I followed a tutorial on Youtube to custom this configuration, you can follow along with this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTLYiNvRIVI) to.

## Try out this config

Make sure to remove or move your current `zsh` directory in your `~/.config`

**IMPORTANT** Requires [Zsh](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-z-shellzsh-on-linux/). 
```
git clone https://github.com/voanhhieu10250/zsh-configuration.git ~/.config/zsh
